   See https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/121 for full MS Details on CVE.
        A denial of service vulnerability exists when .NET Core improperly handles web requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a denial of service against a .NET Core web application. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, without authentication.
      This CVE applies to any .NET Core based application running on .NET Core 2.1.0-2.1.12, or .NET Core 2.2.0-2.2.6. FSS Desktop Client is pinned to .Net core SDK > 5.0.302 which is not vunerable.

   file name: Serilog.Sinks.File:5.0.0
   8117-softmagic.c in file before 5.21 does not properly limit recursion, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption or crash) via unspecified vectors.
      9652-The mconvert function in softmagic.c in file before 5.21, as used in the Fileinfo component in PHP before 5.4.37, 5.5.x before 5.5.21, and 5.6.x before 5.6.5, does not properly handle a certain string-length field during a copy of a truncated version of a Pascal string, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds memory access and application crash) via a crafted file.
    This is a false positive. These two CVEs references a C library softmagic.c which is not used by FSS Desktop Client.

    This is a false positive in readelf.c as FSS Desktop Client is not using this, or PHP.
